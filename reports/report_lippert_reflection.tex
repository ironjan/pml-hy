The most important lesson I learned was: do more regular checks of a deployed system. Many of the problems were discovered too late because ``it worked on my local machine''. All of these could have been avoided by checking the web app more regularly or setting up some service to check the system.

Another important lession was that doing machine learning without previous experience is hard. This was my first machine learning course; learning the methods and implementing at the same time was very challenging. However, the gained experience was worth it.\todo{add note: don't experiment with model on production. use some background stuff -> dark launch}
