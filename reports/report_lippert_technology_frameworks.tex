To implement this project, Ruby on Rails, Python and Scala were considered. I used Ruby on Rails in previous projects and development is quite fast with this framework. However, I could only find a few libraries that deal with machine learning \cite{bigml} \cite{leanpanda}. 
Another choice of language was python. Python has quite a lot pf machine learning libraries and is also used in academics. However, I do not have much previous experience with python.

My final choice was the \href{Play! framework}{https://playframework.com} with Scala. I did use this framework in previous projects and therefore was familiar with setting up background jobs and how to enable web access. Heroku also supports easy deployment for Play! applications\todo{insert links in final report}. One important factor of this choice was the type-safety of the Scala language and it's usage in machine learning and big data\todo{insert link in final report}. While the problem at hand is certainly not big data, the multitude of existing libraries helped a lot to get started\todo{add links to the libraries in final report}.

I chose to use \href{Smile}{http://haifengl.github.io/smile/index.html}, the ``Statistical Machine Intelligence and Learning Engine''. It was easy to use and documentation is quite extensive. In some cases, the API documentation even references the scientific papers the learning algorithm is based on.
