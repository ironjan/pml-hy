The main data source is the actual parking data which is available online. In addition there are other possible features that may influence parking space availability. Since taking all features into account is not possible, this project will solely focus on the parking data in relation to time. 

\paragraph{Parking Usage Live Data}
The homepage of the ASP Paderborn\footnote{City-Managed service for waste management, city cleaning, and parking.} lists the city managed parking areas and the number of currently free parking spots. 
The data is available on \url{https://www.paderborn.de/microsite/asp/parken_in_der_city/freie_Parkplaetze_neu.php}. A more minimal website is available at \url{https://www4.paderborn.de/ParkInfoASP/default.aspx}. 

The website displays 4 attributes: name, type, capacity, and available spots\footnote{respectively: Parkst√§tte, --, Anzahl, Frei}. After crawling, the parking information will be annotated with the crawling time. The latter will be split into multiple attributes which will be used in the prediction: hour of day \(\hod\), minute of hour \(\moh\), day of week \(\dow\), day of month \(\dom\), week of month \(\wom\), week of year \(\woy\), and \(\yyy\)\footnote{the year is included as a way to keep samples unique in case the project runs more than 1 year.}.

The number of available parking spaces is be called \(y\). With the features defined before, the training data will be a set of tuples of the form  
\[
(\hod, \moh, \dow, \dom, \wom, \woy, \yyy, y)\text{.}
\]

\paragraph{Other data-sources}
It was also considered to enrich the data set by adding event and holiday data as both could influence the parking situation near the city center. In some cases, these events take place on one of the parking areas or directly besides them. However, as most of the big events do not happen while the course ``Practical Project in Machine Learning'' takes place, they will not considered further.

Public holidays like Christmas and Easter may also influence the availability of parking space. \cite{parkendd} modeled this in the feature ``bisFeiertag'', i.e. working days until public holiday. In figure \ref{fig:parkendd_features}, the relevance of the different features used by \cite{parkendd} is displayed\footnote{respectively: minutes, week of year, working days until public holiday, day of week, Sunday openings}. 

The feature was relatively important in the evaluation done by \cite{parkendd}. Nonetheless, it will not be included as the next public holiday is Christi Himmelfahrt on 25th May 2017. Therefore there would be no possibility of verifying the importance of this feature in time.

Weather data was also considered as an additional source of information because, e.g., more people may decide to take the car when it's raining. Although such data is available online in machine-readable formats, it will not be considered to keep the model simple.
