  abstract="In this paper a new parking guiding and information system is described. The system assists the user to find the most suitable parking space based on his/her preferences and learned behavior. The system takes into account parameters such as driver's parking duration, arrival time, destination, type preference, cost preference, driving time, and walking distance as well as time-varying parking rules and pricing. Moreover, a prediction algorithm is proposed to forecast the parking availability for different parking locations for different times of the day based on the real-time parking information, and previous parking availability/occupancy data. A novel server structure is used to implement the system. Intelligent parking assist system reduces the searching time for parking spots in urban environments, and consequently leads to a reduction in air pollutions and traffic congestion. On-street parking meters, off-street parking garages, as well as free parking spaces are considered in our system.

abstract = "The time spent searching for free parking spaces can produce considerable environmental pollution. Information on parking availability can be a powerful instrument for reducing these search costs. This paper develops a demand assignment model to evaluate the benefits of manipulating information with the objective of reducing the time and distances involved in finding a parking-place; including the walking distances involved. Using the full search procedure it was found that improvements of some 10% in efficiency could be achieved, but only at high computational costs. A genetic algorithm was programmed that increases the possibility of finding the optimum information conditions that can be translated into lower emissions of toxic greenhouse gases. "

pages={251-254}, 
abstract={The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effects of different types of parking availability information on system performance using a simulation model. The model consists of three sub-models; demand, performance and information service models. The model is designed to describe the dynamic interaction between demand and system performance and it is possible to examine the time to time fluctuation of driver's parking choice decisions and resulting congestion in car parks. The model can distinguish the difference of a driver's parking choice behavior between with and without availability information, and compare the effects of the different types of availability information. Numerical examples are calculated and it is found that the difference of effects among information types depends on the congestion level of the system},
