One week after the first prototype of the crawler was online, \url{https://www.paderborn.de/microsite/asp/parken_in_der_city/freie_Parkplaetze_neu.php} was non-functional. The number of available parking spaces for the ``Libori-Galerie'' was always set to \(0\).

At the same time, many of the other parking areas were switched to ``Nicht im Parkleitsystem'' (not part of the parking guidance system). Both of these issues were caused by a malfunction of the parking guidance system. Crawling was resumed normally after the parking guidance system was fixed by the provider.

On another note, string values were not expected for the Libori-Galerie. This caused the crawler to crash on every crawl; the crawler was then adapted to be ore resilient to unexpected values: all non-integer values for free spaces will directly be dropped.
