The smile library provides different \href{http://haifengl.github.io/smile/index.html}{learning models for Linear Regression}. After a few experiments, the predictions of three models -- GradientTreeBoost, RandomForests, and RegressionTrees -- were ``not completely off''. Since I do not have 
any previous experience in Machine Learning, the prediction module was implemented to train evaluate multiple models 
with different parametrizations on the crawled data and pick the one with the minimum mean average error to make a 
prediction.  

Currently, there are 8567 predictions in total\footnote{Checked on 11.03.2017 at 7:30pm.}. In the course of the 
project GradientBoostTrees turned out to be the dominating prediction model with 7755 predictions. Only 99 of the 
predictions made by the system were derived from RandomForests and 713 were derived from using a RegressionTree. In the latest 48 hours of predictions, only GradientBoostTrees were chosen as the best model for prediction.
