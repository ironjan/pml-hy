This is a webapp for my participation in the course [Project in Practical Machine Learning](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/courses/582739/2017/k/k/1)
at [Helsinkin Yliopistio (University of Helsinki)](https://www.helsinki.fi/fi). The application itself is online at
[[https://pppb.herokuapp.com/]].

*Description of this course:* The purpose of the course is to introduce students to the problematics of machine learning
in a realistic setting. Students should be able to identify and take into account the "dirtiness" of real online data;
select, justify and implement a machine learning algorithm/technique using a programming environment runnable on a web
server; monitor and report the accuracy of their implementation, including reflection of their choices.

 * Play, Slick.
